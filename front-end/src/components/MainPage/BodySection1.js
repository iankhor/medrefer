              <h2>About Conduit Health</h2>
              <p>Conduit Health is a Telepsychiatry and Telehealth service founded in 2014.</p>
              <p>Conduit Health aims to deliver specialist health care in an effective,
                convenient and readily accessible way for the general population, whilst providing
                additional support for primary care physicians. Due to the significant demand for
                mental health services and having to wait long hours for consultations with specialists,
                Conduit Health is a preferred choice for patients.</p>
              <p>Combining the availability of information technology and professional health care,
                we are able to provide better access to specialist services, especially to those
                living in rural areas. With Conduit Health consults, there is no travel time,
                and the consults can happen in the comfort of one's home.</p>
              <p>Conduit Health does not record any teleconferencing sessions, and ensures
                confidentiality for clients.</p>
